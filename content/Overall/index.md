# 🌐 Introduction

Mohammad Haidar, a passionate quantum computing researcher and innovator, is the creator of the OpenVQE algorithmic suite. His vision led to the creation of OpenVQAn, followed by the establishment of the OpenVQA Community — a global initiative committed to advancing open-source quantum computing tools. Under his leadership, OpenVQA evolved into a dynamic ecosystem connecting developers, researchers, and industry experts across the world.

## ⚛️ Why Quantum Computing Matters

Quantum computing is reshaping the way we think about solving some of the world's most complex problems. With its ability to perform computations beyond the reach of classical computers, quantum technology is emerging as a transformative force in various fields:

- 📊 **Finance**: Advanced risk modeling and portfolio optimization
- 🔗 **Optimization**: Solving large-scale industrial and logistical challenges
- ⚙️ **Physics & Chemistry**: Accurate molecular simulations and material discovery
- 🤖 **Machine Learning**: Enabling novel models and faster training on quantum-enhanced data

## The OpenVQA Package

To bridge the gap between quantum theory and practical applications, we developed the OpenVQA package — a collection of high-quality quantum algorithms designed for NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) devices.

These algorithms are implemented across a wide range of quantum programming frameworks, supported by the global industry:

- **MyQLM** by Eviden (France) – [quantum.edf.fr](https://myqlm.github.io/05_demos.html)
- **Qiskit** by IBM – [qiskit.org](https://qiskit.org/)
- **Cirq** by Google Quantum AI – [quantumai.google/cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq)
- **Q#** by Microsoft – [Azure Quantum](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/quantum/)

## 🔄 From OpenVQA to OpenNISQ: Bridging Algorithms to Real Quantum Devices

As the field matures, we are preparing the next leap: the OpenNISQ platform — a natural extension of OpenVQA tailored for direct use on real NISQ hardware. While OpenVQA provides algorithmic innovation, OpenNISQ will offer a practical environment for testing, validating, and benchmarking these algorithms on real quantum machines.

By enabling real-world proof-of-concept demonstrations, OpenNISQ ensures that both academic and industrial users can:

- Optimize algorithms based on real-device performance
- Evaluate cross-platform behavior and efficiency
- Collaborate globally on hardware-agnostic innovation

## 🔭 Roadmap 2026–2027

We are launching a global OpenNISQ Hub — a collaborative space where developers and researchers can contribute, test, and deploy quantum applications across the NISQ landscape. This will mark a major milestone in uniting quantum software with physical hardware, opening the doors to scalable, industry-relevant innovation.

## 🌍  Looking Ahead: OpenQuantumNet

Our long-term vision is OpenQuantumNet — a worldwide, unified platform gathering all quantum algorithms tested and applied across existing and emerging quantum technologies. It will serve as a centralized hub for:

- Sharing validated quantum algorithms
- Benchmarking across diverse quantum devices
- Driving community-led research and industry-aligned progress
